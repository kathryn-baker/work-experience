    "# Problem\n",
    "The client wants to display the data in the GUI but the data we've been given isn't in the format we want. Use this notebook to work out how to process the raw data into a useful format for plotting the data side by side, and what other combinations of the data the equipment owner might find useful and want to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also likely that the machine operators won't want to see the whole cycle information in one plot, which is why they want to be able to specify a time range in the GUI to display. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples time ranges to test:\n",
    "1. start = '2022-05-03 10:00:00', end = '2022-05-03 10:10:00'\n",

    "## Help\n",
    "I've provided some links below to some help pages for pandas that might help provide ways of manipulating the data in the way we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first hint, we want both the read and the set data to have the same length of dataframe, so we might need to expand the shorter DateTimeIndex to the longer data...\n",
    "\n",
    "We then also need to think about whether all information is relevant:\n",
    "* do we care about a point if there isn't a reading for both the read AND the set? \n",
    "* sometimes in cycle the equipment can go off and give bad readings - can you filter these out?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When things go Wrong\n",
    "Pandas can be quite fiddly to use, especially with DateTimeIndexes etc so I've tried to point out things I came across while doing this that you might face as well! If you get stuck though, drop me a message in the chat with your whole code snippet and an example of the error and I'll try to help. \n",
    "* when manipulating dataframes (e.g. removing null values) you need to assign the result to a new variable to avoid overwriting the original data\n",
    "* pandas doesn't like filtering indexes directly. Instead you'll need to find the subset of the index which matches a condition and then subset the data based on this new series.\n",
    "* it's sometimes easier to plot data with matplotlib rather than trying to combine the use of the pandas df.plot() function\n",
